# rl4bg
Code release for "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Closed-Loop Blood Glucose Control" (MHLC 2020). 

The full code release is currently hosted on the MLD3 gitlab:
https://gitlab.eecs.umich.edu/mld3/rl4bg

An updated/cleaned version may be hosted here in the future (I plan on getting around to it in the next couple of months, but no promises).
